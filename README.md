# Dogeared

## Description

This application was created as a space for readers to build a personal, digital library. It is a tool that can be used to organize books into "Have Read" and "Want to Read" lists. Books may be added, modified, and deleted. The user can attach notes and favorite quotes to the books in their library. Dogeared is also a great tool for book reviewers who want one place to write, edit, and save reviews.
